# barrel-shifter-16

16-bit barrel shifter

A barrel shifter allows multiple bit shifts in a single clock cycle using only combinatorial logic.

Tested with TODO: FPGA model, etc.

I made this to learn the basics of running VHDL on an FPGA.
I also plan on using a barrel shifter in my homebrew CPU project so I needed to figure out how this circuit works.
